# Continental-revolution
Although the majority of sovereigns across the world behave cautiously against cryptocurrencies, most of them support the blockchain technology itself. Blockchain technology is becoming a new high ground in global competition as AI, internet of things and cloud computing once were. But using enhanced technologies has become a new concern for people encountering their great complexity.  Therefore a user friendly platform with beneficial services in it, is really appreciated. Continental Protocol tries to offer beneficial services and technologies in the form of dapp with the friendliest user interface for the users in an integrated platform. As development is the secret of survival in digital services, a community based voting system has been prepared on Continental token. It means that any development on Continental platform will be carried out after creating a proposal by core team or community members and holding a poll by the token holders.  If the proposal gains enough votes on behalf of the token holders and number of votes reaches to a quorum and also the majority of token holders vote for the proposal, it will be approved by Continental team and will go under development. Voting mechanism will result into an active community proposing unique ideas and also a constant development on Continental platform As a result, the platform will keep growing, continuously and efficiently.
